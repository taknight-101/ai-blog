## Intro

After building a wide variety of projects—both for clients and personal usage—using multiple frameworks and programming languages, I came to the following conclusions that serve as action items in my design thinking before taking any steps into building a new project.

This blog focuses specifically on **full-stack web applications**.

## The Importance of Business Context

Let me talk some business first:

As it’s the business you are building that serves as the core motive for going forward and deciding better, you won’t want to cause yourself a huge technical debt resulting from poor choices of stacks (talking end-to-end) or having a long lead time that causes other candidates to win over you by releasing faster, while you are still drafting your overthought design in a perfect world that will never cease to exist.

Before doing anything, you have to take a long breath, explore your options wisely, strip away any distractions and potential blockers, and have a clear vision that perfectionism is a harmful thing.

In a frequently changing agile development environment, with the ease of the rate of change, flexibility becomes essential. Avoid locking yourself into one choice or another. Be an **agnostic thinker** and a **true problem solver** who values risks before they happen. Don’t overreact but act when necessary—working in a **pragmatic, no-more-no-less way**, unless a valid motive exists to support a move.

## Lessons Learned

I was fortunate to be a decision-maker early in my career. This allowed me to improvise, make mistakes, learn from them, and later qualify my methods while quantifying the outcomes. This reduced the gap between the required end results and the end result I initially thought was correct.

From this standpoint, I’m sharing what comes to mind before any engagement.

However, I must point out that I still don’t have thorough knowledge of every design, business use case, programming language, or technique. I’m still learning—learning never ends. My approaches and what you are currently reading will evolve over time. **Evolution is paramount.**

## Technical Foundations

Let’s start the technical talk:

A **full-stack application** can be many things. From design to implementation consisting of lines of code, many processes, communication patterns, and abstraction layers must cooperate to fulfill the end-to-end processing pipeline of data, in transient states or at rest in some storage volume.

### Concerns and Their Implementation

#### Example: Logging

Implementing a concern—whether core or cross-cutting—can be laid out in different ways, through different architectures, design patterns, programming paradigms, or best practices.

Say you are implementing logging in your application. This logging may seem simple, like redirecting standard output or errors to a log medium, such as the terminal of the app server running in production. This might be sufficient for a simple app with well-tested functions and limited changing requirements, where:

- A user rarely experiences unforeseen runtime bugs.
- An admin or operator can debug operational issues without difficulty.

However, this simplicity might not apply to **enterprise applications**, where:

- Multiple modules cause different stacks of errors, sourced from various processes.
- Consolidated, centralized logging mechanisms are required to monitor runtime behavior.
- Stack traces need to reflect the processing pipeline from source to destination, especially in **microservices** or **SOA-based applications**, where services may use different programming languages and runtime environments.

#### Example: Security

Another example of a concern is the **security of your application**.

A business use case might fit an implementation of simple stored credentials of its users in the same database as the application, while following best practices such as:

- Hashing user passwords.
- Implementing user session state.

However, one could argue that this still poses security risks on the application if a malicious user brute-forces the hashed passwords. For example:

- If the application doesn't implement **rate limiting** and block such activity, it remains vulnerable.
- The fact that this application is considered a **public client** in OAuth terms—namely internet-connected and accessible by users without restrictions—poses additional challenges, unlike private corporate networks where only certain in-house users are allowed.

Additionally, having the application manage identity and access concerns within its **core business domain** makes it vulnerable to **OWASP-like attacks**.

Such challenges require:

- **Mitigation tests**, such as **pen-testing**, to identify and reduce vulnerabilities.
- Following **security best practices** upfront to overcome these challenges and focus more on the business functions of the application.

These examples emphasize the need for diverse talents and skill sets for building full-stack web applications. I haven’t even mentioned other roles like:

- Testers (manual and automated).
- Ops teams (DevOps, DevSecOps, MLOps, etc.), based on the business model.

## Business Functionality and Types of Applications

I classify applications based on **business function** and **technical requirements**. At this point, I hope it’s clear that **business success is the end goal**, and your solution architecture must align with that.

### Types of Businesses

I’ll mention businesses I’ve actively worked in, come across during my career, or aspire to work with in the future. This blog will evolve as my thoughts and experiences grow.

#### By Size:

1. **Small and Medium Businesses**

   - Serve specific personas with targeted goals in specific domains (e.g., private sector).
   - Example: A supermarket creating an app for automating stock management and purchasing workflows, increasing profit, and improving workflow transparency.

2. **Large Businesses**
   - Serve larger, more diverse audiences with more personas.
   - Require apps that emphasize resiliency and availability to ensure continuity and success.

#### By Openness:

1. **Public Applications**

   - Accessible globally or regionally (e.g., e-commerce apps, social networks like Twitter or Facebook).
   - These apps require strict adherence to functional and non-functional requirements, as downtime can heavily impact business outcomes.

2. **Private Networked Clients**  
   This type of application is typically accessible from a **private server** and is meant to be deployed and used in a controlled environment.

   - **Internet access is not required**, and the target audience is scoped.
   - An example is a **supermarket system**, where the application is used exclusively for internal operations, such as inventory management and transactions. It is accessible only from the **local area network (LAN)** of the market.

## Technical Implementation

### Small to Medium Apps

For small to medium apps, I would go with a simple architecture of a **monolith**, where:

- All application business logic resides in a single process.
- There is a single backing database service.
- The communication pattern uses lightweight CRUD-style JSON-formatted payloads that fly to and from the application.

Typically, for such a use case, I would pick a lightweight stack where flexibility and speed exist to draft a quick working MVP without any hassle of setup and boilerplate code—something that compiled languages like C# and Java pose with their respective and famous frameworks, **.NET** and **Spring**.

Even though these frameworks now do their best to automate much of the hassle of boilerplate setup for you (e.g., **Spring Boot** projects, where convention over configuration is highly utilized to speed up the process), I still find it better to go with an **interpreted stack** like **Node.js and JavaScript** or **Python's Flask**, as they still outperform in the ease of bootstrapping and follow-up maintenance of the codebase.

Think of a C# .NET MVC Core application:

- You have the typical, well-known MVC architecture, where:
  - **Model classes** encapsulate your data models and optional data validation logic.
  - **Controllers** handle requests as the first entry point.
  - **Views** render server-side pages using frameworks like **Blazor** or **Razor views**.
- The database typically follows a **Repository Pattern**, with an ORM like **Entity Framework** mapping relational models into object-oriented ones.
- Dependency injection frameworks facilitate object creation through **Inversion of Control**.

The same is true in the **Java Spring ecosystem**, where:

- You follow a similar MVC-style structure.
- **Spring Data JPA** and **Hibernate** are used for ORM.
- The **DTO Pattern** is often used to implement model objects.
- Annotations and reflection are extensively used for cases like validation, bean creation, and beyond.

If all this doesn’t sound like much of a ceremony for you to grasp or wrap your head around, I can assure you that you will still need to implement your own patterns and customizations to follow clean code practices and maintain a cohesive structure that is easily tested and maintained over time.

Such concerns might not necessarily arise in small businesses, where you just need to come up with an MVP quickly to show your client, get their buy-in, and continue moving forward faster.

That’s why I believe that, in this case, **picking an interpreted style of stack**, such as **Node.js** or **Python's Flask** for the backend, would serve you better.

#### Backend

I would select lightweight stacks to quickly draft a working MVP:

- **Node.js and JavaScript**
- **Python (Flask)**

#### Frontend

I prefer React-based frameworks for flexibility and speed. **Next.js** is my go-to choice because it:

- Provides fast bootstrapping and easy integration with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and component libraries.
- Balances simplicity and performance (e.g., server components in Next.js).

For example, compared to Angular:

- Angular offers many features that may not be required in smaller apps.
- Angular’s structure (e.g., modules, template syntax, and services) adds overhead for small, quick projects.

#### Cohesion and Maintenance

The last point I want to mention in this blog—for it to not be long and distracting—is how I would choose the frontend and backend components of my system.

To cut things short:

- I would follow a **separation of concern approach**, where the framework does not consolidate the frontend for me by means of **server-sent pages**, unless it's wise to do so for performance reasons (like **server components** in Next.js, for example).
- I wouldn't like to maintain separate codebases for the front and back ends. For example, I wouldn't choose to maintain a codebase for my Node.js backend and a different one for the React frontend.

To address this:

- I would need to use a framework, but at the same time, I would need to escape the shortcomings I mentioned earlier about using a framework.
- To **balance things out**, I would prefer using a framework that offers **cohesion** in maintaining a **single full-stack codebase** in the same repository.
- It should also provide:
  1. **Fast bootstrapping**
  2. **Easy convention-over-configuration mechanics** stemming from:
     - Having an **interpreted language** as the backing runtime environment.
     - The **great abstractions** the framework hides away from me, allowing me to focus on the **business logic** instead of other distractions.

Here, **Next.js** again comes into the picture. This is how I would go about it for small to medium businesses, unless my initial study and thought about the long-term requirements of the business imposes otherwise.

So, i would avoid:

- Frameworks that consolidate frontends into server-sent pages unless performance requires it.
- Maintaining separate codebases for frontend and backend.

And instead, use a framework like Next.js, which allows:

- **Single codebase maintenance**.
- Abstractions that let me focus on business logic.

## Closing Thoughts

That’s all for now. I’ve kept this initial blog concise, focusing on small to medium applications.

Future blogs will explore:

- How to architect monoliths to reflect the business domain using techniques like **domain-driven design**.
- How to build other types of business applications using architectures like microservices and DevOps automation.
